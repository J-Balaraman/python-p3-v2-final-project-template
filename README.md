The Library CLI is a versatile command-line interface meticulously designed for the holistic management of a diverse collection of books and genres within a database. This tool empowers users to seamlessly access, modify, create, and delete entries spanning a wide range of literary works. Whether exploring the realms of fantasy, engaging with non-fiction narratives, or immersing in the nuances of realistic fiction, this CLI provides an intuitive solution for organizing and maintaining an extensive library of diverse books. With its user-friendly commands and structured approach, the Library CLI caters to the needs of readers seeking an effective tool for comprehensive library management.

# Installation
To use the Library CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies using Pipenv:**
   Ensure you have Pipenv installed. Then, run the following commands to set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```
   This command activates the virtual environment, isolating your CLI project from other Python installations on your system.

5. **Run the CLI:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This command launches the Library CLI, enabling you to start managing your book entries and genres from the command line.

Remember to replace "your-username" and "your-repo" with your actual GitHub username and repository name. This guide reflects the use of Pipenv for dependency management and creating a virtual environment.
